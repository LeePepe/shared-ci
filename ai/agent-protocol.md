# Repository agent protocol (W3)

Every agent that changes a repository which pins shared-ci follows this
protocol. It does not depend on any particular tool. The repository's
`AGENTS.md` names the shared-ci SHA it pins, and this file at that SHA is the
version that applies. When a rule here conflicts with a prompt, this file wins.
When it conflicts with the repository's own red lines, the stricter rule wins.

## 1. Before you edit

1. Read in this order: the constitution (if present), then the root
   `tech-context.md`, then the leaf `tech-context.md` of every layer you will
   touch. `AGENTS.md` lists the paths.
2. Use a dedicated branch **and** a dedicated worktree for the task. Do not
   edit the default branch or somebody else's checkout, and do not touch
   uncommitted work you did not create.
3. **One writer.** Only one agent writes to a branch at a time. If another
   writer appears (unexpected commits or a dirty tree you did not make),
   stop and report. Do not merge over it or reset it.

## 2. Scope

- Resolve every path you plan to change:
  `scripts/context/resolve <path> --format layer`. Change only paths owned by
  the layers your task names. If a change needs another layer, say so in the
  PR and keep that edit minimal. Do not refactor across layers along the way.
- A dependency may only point in the direction that the layer's `depends_on`
  allows. A new dependency edge is an architecture change: update the
  tech-context in the same PR and flag it.
- Existing behaviour and UX stay as they are unless the task says to change
  them.

## 3. Verify with the same entry as CI

- Run `scripts/verify` before every push. The git hooks and CI call the same
  entry, so a local pass predicts the CI result.
- Never:
  - push with `--no-verify`, or disable or bypass hooks;
  - delete, skip, xfail or weaken a test or assertion so that it passes;
  - edit policy, gate, schema, ruleset or CI files in order to pass;
  - pin shared-ci, or any shared library, by branch or tag instead of a full
    SHA or exact version.
- If a check is wrong, fix it in its own PR that states the reason and needs
  Owner review. Do not work around it in a feature PR.

## 4. Pull request

What a PR must be:

- **Base is the default branch.** A PR must be mergeable on its own. Do not
  make it depend on another open PR being merged first.
- **One purpose.** Split unrelated fixes, refactors and features.
- **One layer scope where possible.** If a PR crosses layers, say why in
  Intent.
- **Stacked PRs** are allowed only as a temporary queue. Once the base PR
  merges, retarget the next PR to the default branch and rebase it onto that
  branch, dropping the base PR's pre-squash commits
  (`git rebase --onto origin/main <old-base-tip>`), before it merges. A squash
  merge rewrites the base commits, so a stacked branch that is not rebased
  will conflict or carry duplicate changes.

Fill in every section of the repository's PR template:

| Section | Content |
| --- | --- |
| Existing behaviour | What the code does today, including behaviour that must be kept |
| Intent | What changes and why; the task or issue link |
| Compatibility | API/data/config compatibility, migrations, rollback |
| Removed or weakened tests or policy | Each item with its reason and who approved it, or `none` |
| Test evidence | `scripts/verify` result and the **tested SHA** (the PR head) |

The `quality / aggregate` check rejects empty or placeholder sections.

## 5. Evidence belongs to one SHA

- Evidence (checks, reviews, the tested SHA in the PR body) is valid only for
  the commit it names. **Every new push invalidates the old evidence.** Wait
  for the new required checks and a new review before you claim the work is
  done.
- "Done" means the required checks are green on the PR head SHA. A finished
  local run is not "done", and a sent message is not an accepted handoff.

## 6. Important PRs need the Owner

Changes under `CODEOWNERS` paths need Owner approval (for example
`.github/**`, policy, schemas, gates, `AGENTS.md`, the constitution,
dependency pins, credentials, privacy and data migrations). The same applies
to any PR that removes or weakens a test, or changes existing behaviour
without an approved spec. Until the repository enforces CODEOWNERS review,
add the `owner-review` label and wait.

## 7. Incidents become rules

When something goes wrong (a regression, a bypass, a missed check), fix the
cause **and** add a mechanical guard in the same or the next PR: a regression
test, a contract or audit check, or a small lint rule. Do not answer an
incident by making a prompt longer. If the guard belongs in shared-ci, open a
shared-ci PR and link it.

## 8. Never commit

- Credentials, tokens or keys.
- Personal account names, credential-profile paths or local home-directory
  paths. `scripts/context audit` rejects them.
- Generated local evidence files. The PR and its checks are the record.

## 9. When you are blocked

Stop and report the blocker, what you tried, and what you need. Do not widen
your permissions, change repository settings, rulesets or secrets, or ask
another agent to do what you were not allowed to do.
